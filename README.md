commonwealth.js
===============

An implementation of [hierarchical state machines](http://bears.ece.ucsb.edu/class/ece253/samek0311.pdf) in JavaScript.

## Project Goals
- Finite State Machines and Hierarchical State Machines
- Unique features that take advantage of JS's particular characteristics
- Easy to understand and very straightforward to implement
- Based on Practical use cases rather than pure theory
- Super testy! Created by TDD with QUnit. [Check out the test suite](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?http://github.com/mimshwright/commonwealth.js/master/test/index.html)

## Why Commonwealth?

Most names involving "states" or "state machines" were taken. Four of the states of the United States officially use the term "commonwealth" rather than "state."
